Allows apps on mobile devices to auto-discover and connect to each other via Wi-Fi and Bluetooth without any intervention from the user and without using any Internet connection;\r\n\r\n2. Works both in foreground and background app modes;\r\n\r\n3. Allows asynchronous transfer of messages, photos and sounds — all without freezing the UI of the app;\r\n\r\n4.
